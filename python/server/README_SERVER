Statistics server
=================

Gather eye tracking data by starting 
server_main.py with command line arguments:
  
  index,  e.g 1
  game,   e.g starcraft2, portal2 or coh
  ratio,  e.g 16:9
  path,   e.g ./
  ip,     e.g 10.76.155.133
  post,   e.g 3031

Example
=======

python server_main.py 1 coh 16:9 ./ 10.76.155.133 3031

Scripts
=======
There are two scripts ready to run StraCraft2 on et1.bream.io or et2.bream.io
You must execute the scripts from the parent directory
e.g. ./scripts/run_et1

This will open a prompt with the following command structure:

	>> [COMMAND][MODULE/NAME]

COMMANDS
	log [MODULE]
	Will enable logging output from [MODULE] 
	disable with nolog command

	nolog [MODULE]
	Disables the logging invoked by the log command

	start [NAME]
	Starts an eye-tracking session with [NAME] which starts gathering 
	et-data and output statistics at ../../statistics and 
	heatmaps at ../../heatmaps. Will continue to output data until 
	commands stop or kill are invoked

	stop
	Is invoked without arguments and stops the current eye-tracking session.
	Will create a summary of the statistics and heatmaps in 
	../../matches/[NAME] specified in start command. 

	kill
	Same as stop.
